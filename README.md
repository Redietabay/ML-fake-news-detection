Fake News Detection System

Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project

 Overview

Fake news has become a major challenge in today’s digital world.
This project aims to automatically detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques.

The system classifies news text as Fake or Real and includes:

Data preprocessing & cleaning

Multiple ML and DL models

Model comparison

A simple web interface for prediction

 Project Goals

Build an end-to-end fake news classification system

Apply NLP techniques to real-world text data

Compare classical ML models with deep learning (LSTM)

Practice professional ML project structure and GitHub workflow

   Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled news articles:

Fake.csv – fake news articles

True.csv – real news articles

After cleaning and preprocessing, a combined dataset is used for training models.

  In real-world projects, large datasets are usually not pushed to GitHub.
Instead, dataset sources are referenced.
